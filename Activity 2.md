## Overview

### Description
Ranter is a mobile app that lets users record and publish tiny podcast episodes (30–60 seconds) straight from their phones. Users can scroll through a feed of short audio posts, interact with other creators, and explore trending micro-podcasts in an engaging social format.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

 - **Description**: This will be a 60-second podcast recorder: It will allow users record and publish tiny podcast episodes (30-60 seconds from their phones, basically like tiktok but for audios)
   - **Category:** Social Networking
   - **Mobile:** MMobile is essential because users record short voice clips on the go, publish instantly from their phone, and listen to others’ micro-podcasts. The microphone is core to the experience.
   - **Story:** Helps people share thoughts, stories, advice, rants, updates, or opinions without needing full podcast equipment. Makes podcasting fast, casual, and accessible — anyone can speak, post, and connect with listeners in seconds.
   - **Market:** Content creators, students, influencers, commuters, storytellers, or anyone who enjoys sharing quick audio updates. Could appeal to users who like platforms like TikTok, Twitter, YikYak, or short-form voice messaging.
   - **Habit:** Users return daily to record quick rants, listen to trending micro-podcasts, follow creators, or respond to audio threads. Short episodes encourage frequent engagement.
   - **Scope:**V1: Record a 60-second audio clip + publish + basic feed.

            V2: Add likes, comments, follows, and audio filters.

            V3: Add trending topics, hashtags, and personalized     feeds.

            V4: Add collaboration features (duets, replies), analytics, and monetization for creators
